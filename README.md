# Clone-Advisor

This repository contains the code described in paper "Clone-Advisor: Recommending Code Tokens and Clone Methods with Deep Learning and Information Retrieval". The paper is underreview at PeerJ Computer Science Journal. 

Moreover, we are sharing DeepClone model which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r152xqs5rdsvvq1/AABsMH-iCbgpSjE3Vy9d3zVWa?dl=0">this link</a>. Further explanation about DeepClone model can be found in our paper on  <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64694-3_9">"DeepClone: Modeling Clones to Generate Code Predictions"</a>, which is published at ICSR 2020 conference. Finally, it contains dataset and results generated in empirical evaluation of methodology.
